<p> I am a student in University of Toronto, studying Engineering Science, specializing in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
<p> I can code fluently in C, C++, Verilog, and have had experiences in Perl, SystemVerilog, Java, and basic web programming</p>
<p> My past industrial experiences include working with both hardware electronics and software design. There are more details on all the projects I've worked on at the right bar</p>
<p> Some notable traits of mine as a worker are my time-management skills, and a good sense in programming in general. 
When it comes to multiple projects and deadline, I'm able to efficiently allocate my resource within the given time frame. 
Couple it with my "instinct" in debugging with programs makes me excel at verifying software structures and designs.</p>
<p> I also excel at working within a team. Being able to maintain good relationship with my co-workers and the ability to complete tasks on time makes me an invaluable asset to a team-based project.
I play well as a team-member, but am not afraid to lead. </p>
